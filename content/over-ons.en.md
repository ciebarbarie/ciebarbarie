Compagnie Barbarie is a theatre collective of five women who tackle contemporary themes and always manage to translate them to a child’s perspective.<br>

Both children and adults are faced with a rapidly changing world, and no one really knows how the day we’ve started will end.<br> Together, we explore the questions of our time and search for meaning in a world that never stands still.<br>

Cie Barbarie doesn’t shy away from any subject, isn’t afraid of a bit of rebellion, and finds its footing in humour, absurdity, and a healthy dose of everyday self-mockery.<br>


**Company Barbarie are**: Liesje De Backer, Karolien De Bleser, Amber Goethals, Lotte Vaes and Sarah Vangeel
