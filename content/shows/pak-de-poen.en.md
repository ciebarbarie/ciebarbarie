Come and enrich yourself in the most greedy show of the year!<br>
Because “Cash in!”, allows children to earn money. <br>
A lot of money. <br>
Of which you, as a parent, can only dream.<br>

“Cash In!” will be a spectacular show with major prizes, crazy challenges and defying questions in which children decide for themselves how far they’re willing to go to get what they want.

_Is there a stop to growth or is it a goal in itself?_<br>
_How difficult is sharing, really?_<br>
_Where does desire stop and greed start?_<br>
_Is more always better by definition?_<br>
_Money produces money. That’s what they say. If we keep producing more money,_<br>
_when, then, will there be enough for everybody?_

Raising children and making them aware of the value of money is not a simple task.<br>
On the one hand, we want to teach our children responsibility, make them realise<br>
that things don’t just drop down from the sky for free and that everything has its price.<br>
On the other hand, we tell them that not everything is for sale,<br>
That money shouldn’t be a goal in itself and what really matters, is priceless.

Dealing with money, always wanting more, the bigger, the better.<br>
It’s familiar to children and to grown-ups.

“The end of capitalism is near!”. That’s what’s being said, hoped, feared.<br>
So come and grab, grope and possess, while we still can!
