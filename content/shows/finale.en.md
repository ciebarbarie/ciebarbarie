**Finale**<br>

_For everyone aged 6 and up_

Something stops.<br>
Something breaks.<br>
When something is broken, you can't play with it anymore.<br>
Unless with the pieces. But sometimes those are too sharp and can hurt.<br>
So that's not allowed again.<br>
Many things break.<br>
Lamps. Faucets. Pants. Winter coats.<br>
People too.<br>
People break too.<br>
People even break so badly that they die.<br>
And then they have to go away.<br>
Not in the regular garbage bin of course, like the lamps and the faucets and the winter coats.<br>
But they do go away.<br>
To never come back again.<br>
And that, that is really very, very sad.<br>
That they never come back?<br>
It's incomprehensible.<br>
And unfair. And rotten. And cunt and fuck and shit. Sorry for the dirty words. You're not supposed to say those out loud of course.<br>
But that's how it feels.<br>

With 'Finale', **compagnie barbarie** presents a performance about finitude and temporality.<br>
And, to use the big word: about death.<br>
A performance that makes you realize that dying means you never come back.<br>
And that you can feel everything you feel about it.<br>
