**Premiere**<br>

The performance will start at the beginning.<br>
That is quite logical. Starting at the beginning is always helpful to follow along.<br>
The first scene will be the opening scene with which the performance begins.<br>
Of course, the performance only starts when it has started.<br>
The beginning will be clear.<br>
A beginning.<br>
Something like: ‘Start’. Yes. That's how it will go.<br>
We are not going to start foolishly with ‘false start’ and ‘actually it had already started but no one had noticed’ or ‘does it ever really start?’.<br>
No, no. We will not start like that.

But for now, you have to wait a bit. Until it starts.<br>
Although you yourself have been at it for quite a while. Nine years. Or eight. Or twelve. Or seventy-five.<br>
Or maybe you just feel like it never really starts.<br>
And that you are waiting. Until it finally happens.<br>
You know. The real beginning. When you are older… And bigger…<br>
Or maybe you long for a new beginning. A new friend. A new school. A new pencil case. One without a past. Without a story.

And sometimes you feel that adults suddenly look at you strangely. With a glistening tear in their eye. Then they stroke your hair and say: ‘Oh, I wish I were like you. For you, it all still has to begin.’<br>
But does such a thing as a new beginning exist?<br>
Is a blank page really as blank as we would like it to be?<br>
How defining is a beginning for everything that is yet to come?
