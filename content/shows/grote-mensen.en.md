**Grown-Ups**<br>

**An absurdly tragic horror comedy about the ups and downs of grown-ups when the children aren't looking.**<br>

Grown-ups work.<br>
And children play. Or go to school. Or they sleep.<br>
And when they sleep, the grown-ups have to keep working. In the living room. On their computers. After they've cleaned the kitchen.<br>

But what do grown-ups actually *do*? When the children are at school, what do they do all day long? Do they run the world? Take a nap? Or make a mess of things? Do these grown-ups actually *have* things under control? Are they *really* cleaning up all the mess everyone leaves behind? Or will it be up to the children to clean everything up later?

Because who actually cleans up whose mess?
