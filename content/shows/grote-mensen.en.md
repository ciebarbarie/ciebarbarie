**Big People**<br>

**A performance about the adult world.**<br>

Big people work.<br>
And children play. Or go to school. Or they sleep.<br>
And when they sleep, big people still have to continue working. In the living room. On their computers. After they've cleaned the kitchen.<br>

But what do big people actually do for real? When the children are in school, what do they do all day long? Do they run the world? Take a nap? Or make a mess of things?<br>

This latest performance by compagnie barbarie visually explores everything that big people do/don't do/should do/say they do/would never be able to but actually want to do. Because do adults really have control? We delve into the universe that a child never sees. In a Barbarian-comedic way, we dig into the fantasy world and let the events of one day wonderfully derail. An absurdly tragic horror comedy about the ups and downs of big people when the children aren't looking.

Because do adults actually have things under control? Are they pointing in the right direction? Are they taking care of the world they will leave for the children? Are they really cleaning up all the mess that everyone leaves lying around? Or will it be up to the children to clean it all up later?

Because who actually cleans up whose mess?
