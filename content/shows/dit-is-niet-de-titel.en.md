**This Is Not The Title**<br>

**We have created a new performance about lying.**<br>
**Although that's not entirely true.**

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/808728449" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

That is to say:<br>
We don't lie all the time. At least not in the performance. We also do other things. That are also fun.<br>
But not as fun as lying.<br>
Not that lying is fun.<br>
At least not for everyone.<br>

Certainly not for the one being lied to.<br>
They usually don't find lying fun.<br>
Unless they don't realize it, of course.<br>

Lying is only bad when found out, right?<br>
And lying is not the same as tricking.<br>
But you have to say that in time. That it wasn't true. That you were lying.<br>
Well, lying, making it up. For the joke.<br>

Little joke.

Lying is also not always lying.<br>
Lying is a strong word.<br>
Lying is saying a lot.<br>
Sometimes it was just an idea.<br>
Like: 'it could have been like this too.'<br>
Because that's true, right?<br>
It could have been like this or like that, right? That could have happened, right?<br>
Even if it wasn't really like that.<br>
But what is really real. Who knows that? Aha!<br>

Being good at lying is important.<br>
But so is being honest.<br>
Even though honesty takes far too long.<br>

So we tell you now:<br>
THIS IS NOT THE TITLE is about lying.<br>
But we can't promise you that's the truth.
